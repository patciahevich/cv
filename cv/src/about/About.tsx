        <h3> About me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Volha, and I decided to change careers to fulfill a long-standing dream of working in the IT field. I’ve always been passionate about math and computer science, but my professional journey began in medicine. </p> 
        <p>Working as a doctor and managing a healthcare facility, I developed essential skills in organization, time management, and effective problem-solving.</p>
        <p>Over time, I realized that I wanted to work in a field where I could create something new and see tangible results from my efforts. Writing my first line of code felt like magic, inspiring me to move forward and dedicate myself to development.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m focused on improving my development skills and striving to become a professional who creates valuable and impactful products.</p>
